      <h3>Some Updates</h3>
      <p>Personal | Future Goals | This is literally just rambling because I can't be bothered to organize this right now </p>
      <p>I'm taking this semester off of CMU to work on gen eds at my local college.</p>
      <p>I took <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/">Introduction to Computer Systems</a> over the summer, so it felt like a good idea to get away for a little while. Partially, this change in location is for physical therapy/a bunch of other doctors' appointments that I could never fit into my class schedule while taking CS courses. Partially, this is letting me take a step back to work on side projects and figure out what direction I really want to go with art and programming.</p>
      <p>There's a lot I'm excited to be working on. Currently, I'm teaching myself <a href="https://puredata.info">puredata</a> and it's been a blast. I've been hearing about visual programming languages for ages now, but imagining them is very different from actually using them. It's rekindling my interest in datavis (which I'd put on a small hold--at some point, I realized my biggest obstacle was a lack of knowledge about formal design, which I knew would take a considerable amount of time to approach).</p>
      <p>As I learn I'm catching myself wondering about stuff, like can we use sound to help "visualize" data? Use a few measures of a melody to relay high level information, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline">Tufte's sparklines</a>? Would sound + data help make number-heavy fields more accessable to people with impaired vision? Or would it be too infeasible to work, and leave data-driven music in the art world only?</p>
      <p>More later, but some other things I'm working on include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Going to the gym regularly - twice as exciting after the studies I've recently read about how lactic acid cause <a href="http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v5/n5/full/tp201567a.html">ASICs in the amygdala</a> to stimulate a fear response</li>
        <li>Uh, I guess still reading scientific publications (does this go without saying?). I discovered my enrollment in my local school gives me full access to PubMed, and I don't know if I already had this with CMU, but I'm definitely taking advantage of it this semester.</li>
        <li>Developing a set of fast, easy, and healthy meals I can make back in Pittsburgh. No shame in spice packs and premate sauce anymore, if it has me meal prepping instead of buying pre-prepared food every day</li>
        <li>Maybe giving myself time to paint? (It's been so long)</li>
        <li>Making my VR Orrery (which has me diving back into Unity, but this time connected to puredata). Stuck sulking about problems with the scaling--planets are so far apart that most model solar systems forgo accurate distances. Feels like cheating, though. Also stuck between A) creating sound myself, as a fun learning experience and B) taking my friend up on getting referred to a few producers who might be interested, which would be good for learning to collaborate on projects like this.</li>
        <li>I was fortunate enough to attend a few workshops on modular synthesizers over the summer in Pittsburgh, and I'd like to continue learning how they work, and transfer the knowledge to digital synths, too. Learning in analog made everything intuitive for the first time ever, but I'll need to know digital tools well if I want to produce music someday. Which I definitely do.</p>

      <h3>Review: <a href='http://tech.gotinder.com/smart-photos-2/'>Smart Photos</a></h3>
      <p>Mobile Apps | Algorithms</p>
      <p>This article is by Mike Hall, Machine Learning Lead at Tinder, about the Smart Photos feature he developed in a hackathon.  More specifically, it gives the reader an understanding both of his hackathon process and a couple of specific ideas, like multi-armed bandit optimization, epsilon greedy, and how to tailor an algorithm for your own use cases.  Three of the major reasons I like this article are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light read</b>: It's an easily-absorbed, high-level explanation of an algorithm and how it was implemented</li>
        <li><b>Unusual Information</b>: Gives a peek into Tinder's inner workings -Tinder just hosted its first internal hackathon? That sounds really fun!</li>
        <li><b>Well-organized</b>: the articles takes you on a journey from the initial problem to a proposed solution to a step-by-step process of achieving that.  While the article surely skipped many failed or sub-par attempts, the progression of "how to pick the best photos?" > "we want A/B testing" > "let's do this as multi-armed bandit optimization" > "which algorithm?" > "epsilon greedy looks good" > "now let's alter this to make it work for tinder" is very compelling from both a narrative and an instructional standpoint</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="l etsgetpersonal">My own personal takeaway is probably mostly research-oriented.  Often, when doing something completely new, I often wonder how much time I should be spending researching rather than doing.  It's easy to spend all your time reading about something and only feeling more and more overwhelmed at how little you know; at the same time, it's also easy to jump into something and spend far too much time reinventing the wheel, when a little reading might have taught you about wheels.</p>
      <p class="l etsgetpersonal">I also learned a bit of new stuff about ranking algorithms, too, which is great.  And as always, I love watching the process of someone doing something, whether a description of their thought process (as in this article), or a video of live coding (especially the sped-up 48hr viedos from Ludum Dare!!), autobiographies (in the middle of athenahealth's cofounder's Where Does It Hurt? and it's really good so far), speedpaints, etc.</p>

      <h3>This Site</h3>
      <p>HTML | CSS</p>
      <p>It's about time I made a site for myself and not other people! While I've looked into tools like Jekyll that would let me keep on using Node.js - and do intend to try Jekyll out sometime for a project that demands it more - it's been a nice excuse to actually use pure html for once.</p>
      <span><a href='https://github.com/OliviaLynn/OliviaLynn.github.io'>View Code</a></span>
      <br />

      <p class="letsgetpersonal">Still, there's no way I'll be able to resist making some really nice interface to generate all the html and perform mass edits and everything else.</p>
      <p class="letsgetpersonal">Also, I totally want to make the site weirdly interactive, plotting the user's mouse movement compared to everyone else's, time spent looking at what sections, how often they jiggle their mouse, how closely centered their clicks tend to be on links, etc.</p>

                  <h3>Floffy Bird: An Exploration in Behavior and Empathy</h3>
                  <p>Pololu 3pi | C++</p>
                  <p>Floffy bird is a tiny fuzzy creature that isn’t afraid of any terrain. Plop it down on any path and it will follow the line all the way to the end. Watch out, though, because it still obeys some of the laws of the world – snow is cold! Floffy bird shivers a lot. Mud is tough, too, so its steps may start dragging – but slowly, slowly, floffy bird will make it through.</p>
                  <p>So what is it scared of? Humans! If you pick it up, it’ll squeak and freeze, because it is just a tiny little bird. If you do decide to grab it, try rubbing its belly, and it just might calm down enough to move.</p>
